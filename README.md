# pandas-for-Data-science

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides data structures and functions needed to work with structured data seamlessly. Two primary components are:

1.Series: A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.

2.DataFrame: A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It's similar to a table in a database or an Excel spreadsheet.

Pandas is highly versatile and is widely used for data analysis tasks including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
